# Hospital Management System
## Description-
   In this Project we aim to solve the traditional issues of hospital management. The existing system provided paper based solution for keeping records of patients and hospital staff, but it gives overload to Doctor,and Administrator.  The main issues were inappropriate data keeping, time wastage in storage, retrieval also patients were unable to understand the prescription etc. These issues are solved by providing a separate user account for doctors and other user. Keeping each patientâ€™s data separate and track previous visits in a single click. 
   
   This project uses MYSQL as backend and is developed in Java so it provides features such as platform independence, high performance and security. It is a web application which mainly uses SpringMVC and JDBC and Servlets frameworks. 
   
   It provides some enhanced features such as: an easy interface to add, remove employees as well as it provides  of prescription. Thus, reducing need to manually write  and  sign  by doctor.  <br>
